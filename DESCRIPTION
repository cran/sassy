Description: A meta-package that aims to make 'R' easier for everyone, 
    especially programmers who have a background in 'SAS®' software.
    This set of packages brings many useful concepts to 'R', including
    data libraries, data dictionaries, formats 
    and format catalogs, a data step, and a traceable log.  The system
    also includes a package that replicates several commonly-used 'SAS®' procedures,
    like 'PROC FREQ', 'PROC MEANS', and 'PROC REG'.
